# Simple Blockchain in Go

This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain in Go. It's designed to help newcomers understand the fundamental concepts of blockchains.

## Features

- **Immutable Ledger**: Once a block has been added to the chain, it cannot be changed, ensuring data integrity.
- **Proof-of-Work Algorithm**: Implemented to ensure security and avoid spam.
- **Chain Validation**: At every step, the integrity of the entire blockchain can be verified.
- **Concurrent Transactions**: Handle multiple transactions efficiently using Go routines.
- **Basic Coin Implementation**: A rudimentary coin system has been integrated.
- **Merkle Tree Impementation**: Implement functions for adding, validating, and storing
 transactions within the blockchain and digital ledger.


## Setup

1. **Initialize Go Module**:
    ```bash
    go mod init <module-name>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

## Usage

```bash
go run <main-file-name>.go
```




## Understanding the Code
Block Structure:
Each block contains data, a timestamp, the previous block's hash, its own hash, and a nonce.

Proof-of-Work:
This mechanism ensures that creating a block requires computational effort. This process, also known as "mining," requires finding a hash that meets certain criteria.

Chain Validation:
Every time an action is performed on the blockchain, the entire chain is validated to ensure its integrity.

Concurrent Transactions:
Multiple transactions can be processed concurrently, demonstrating the power and efficiency of Go's concurrency model.

Future Improvements
Extend the coin system for more intricate transactions.
Implement a peer-to-peer network to allow for distributed ledger capabilities.
Integrate a more persistent form of storage (e.g., databases).
